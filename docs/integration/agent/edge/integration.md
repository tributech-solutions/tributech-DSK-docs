# DSK Agent Edge Integration

## Integration

For DSK Agent Edge integration you can use your existing connectors since the Agent is integrated at the message bus layer.<br/>
The DSK Agent Edge thus supports different data-sources.<br/>
These are implemented as so-called value-sources, one of which could e.g. be an OPC UA implementation.<br/>
If you are interested in creating your own value-source feel free to [contact us](https://www.tributech.io/about-us/).

Configuration Options for the DSK Agent Edge can be found [here](./configuration.md).
