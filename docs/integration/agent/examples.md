# Agent Integration

The DSK Edge Agent supports different data-sources. These are implemented as so-called value-sources. 

## OPC UA

There is an existing data-source for OPC UA Data. If you need more information feel free to [contact us](https://www.tributech.io/about-us/).

## Custom data-source

It is possible to implement your own value-source. It requires the values to be sent as messages over a message bus to the agent. If you are interested in creating your own value source feel free to [contact us](https://www.tributech.io/about-us/).
