## Data exchange reinvented - Secure. Traceable. Trusted.

The Tributech DataSpace Kit enables companies to secure and share data cross-company or cross-process in a selective, tamperproof way while maintaining data sovereignty. This data could be sensor, process or business data. The included trust layer and distributed ledger technology make sure, that the data can be trusted and no one manipulated the data.
