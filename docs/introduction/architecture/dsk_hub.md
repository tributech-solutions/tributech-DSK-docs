# DataSpace Hub

The DataSpace Hub provides the metadata storage and the public key infrastucture that is required for setting up an ecosystem of DataSpace Nodes. In short, the Hub holds all Metadata information required for managing and organization of the secure auditable data sharing between nodes. Note that the Hub does not hold any data itself, thus guaranteeing the data soverignity of the node owners!<br/>
Thus, the Hub is responsible for:

- storing the metadata of published datasets
- adding new DataSpace Nodes to the ecosystem
- issuing of certificates
- managing public keys
- managing identities

> Note: A DataSpace Hub is not on the route of the traffic for the data exchange and even a man-in-the-middle-attack would fail because Hub has no private-key material of DataSpace Nodes or Agents.
