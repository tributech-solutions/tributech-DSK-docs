# Publish a Dataset guide

After the Dataset was successfully created it can now be published for sharing 

## Add Publication

Select one of your Datasets and click on "Add Publication" for the selected Dataset

## Select Public or Invite

Publishing a Dataset means that you make the descriptive metadata visible for other members of your DataSpace Ecosystem, so they can request access to your Datasets and subscribe to them if you grant access. If you want to publish a Dataset you have two different options.

Selecting "Public" means that metadata is visible for all members of the Ecosystem. The data is not automatically shared with all members. Instead other members will get the option to request access to your dataset.

Selecting "Invite" means that the data will only be visible to a selected group of members.

For the purpose of this guide select "Public".

## Select sources and streams

Select the sources and streams you want to share. As you see in the example you can selectively choose which streams you want to publish. If you choose a data source you can select which streams of the data source you want to publish.

### Select a timeframe

Select a timeframe for your Publication or invite. This timeframe sets the period for possible subscribers that they can request. The real consumable timeframe depends on the availability of each stream. The available date for each stream is defined by the metadata field "Available from" that is set at the initial metadata generation.

### Select a contract

If you also want to include some governance, you have the possibility to upload a contract that contains the terms of use that must be agreed upon as part of the Request process. Select the checkbox and upload a PDF file containing your terms of use.

### Publish your Dataset

Before completing the publishing process, please review your selection. After you publish a Dataset, it will be visible for other members (depending on the publishing option) in your DataSpace Ecosystem. After submission, other members can send a Request if they want to consume your data.
