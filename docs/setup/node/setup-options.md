# Setup Options

This page explains the setup options for a DSK node and its prerequisites.

## Prerequisites

### Ecosystem

Your new DSK Node has to join a DataSpace Ecosystem. In general, there are no limitations on how you can structure a DataSpace Ecosystem. We recommend a segmentation in 2 categories:

**Private DataSpace Ecosystems** for the data exchange in your value chain with for example your customers, suppliers and partners.

**Open DataSpace Ecosystems** for the data exchange with businesses, researchers and communities outside your value chain to drive innovation, try new use-cases and services or monetize data.

## DSK Node on Azure

Although other setup options are also available, the easiest way to setup the DSK Node is through the Azure Marketplace.
See the [quick start guide](../../quickstart/install-owner-node.md) on how to setup a node on Azure in the public Dataspace Ecosystem.

## DSK Node On Premise or other Cloud Providers

The DSK Node can also be deployed on premise or in a virtual machine on any of the major public cloud providers. See the [requirements](./node-requirements.md) and [contact us](https://www.tributech.io/about-us/).
