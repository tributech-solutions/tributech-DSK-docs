# Integration

The DSK can be integrated on many levels, for which an overview is given here.

## DSK Node

The DSK Node provides a set of REST APIs to access data as well as verify data authenticity and data integrity. Learn more about how to use them in our [node integration guide](./node/overview.md).

## DSK Agent

The DSK Agent can be integrated depending on the variant that you are working with:

- [DSK Agent Edge](./agent/edge.md)
- DSK Agent Embedded
- [DSK Agent Integrated](./node/overview.md)

Read more about integration details for the **DSK Agent Edge** [here](./agent/edge.md).

The **DSK Agent Integrated** can be used through the Trust-Api - please read about how to use it at the [node integration guide](./node/overview.md).
