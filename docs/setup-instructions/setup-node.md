## Infrastructure requirements

The requirement to install a DataSpace Node depends significantly on the amount of data being processed. As a standard infrastructure setup, we recommend that you meet the following requirements:

| Type          | Minimum Requirement | Recommend Requirement |
| :---          |    :----            |    :----              |
| OS            |Ubunto 18.04 LTS or higher|n/a               |
| CPU           |2 Cores              |4 Cores                |
| RAM           |8 GB RAM             |16 GB RAM              |
| Storage       |100 GB + storage for data depending on config|n/a|

If you have any questions regarding infrastructure requirements, please talk to your contact person at Tributech our send an email to our [Customer Advisory Team](mailto:customer-advisory@tributech.io).

## Select a DataSpace Ecosystem

If you install a new DataSpace Node in your infrastructure you have to join a DataSpace Ecosystem. In general, there are no limitations on how you can structure a DataSpace ecosystem. We recommend a segmentation in 2 categories:

**Private DataSpace Ecosystems** for the data exchange in your value chain with for example your customers, suppliers and partners.

**Open DataSpace Ecosystems** for the data exchange with businesses, researchers and communities outside your value chain to drive innovation, try new use-cases and services or monetize data.

**If you want to join a DataSpace, please slelect one of the follwoing options:**

- Existing ecosystem - please contract the operater of this ecosystem
- New ecosystem - please contact our [Customer Advisory Team](mailto:customer-advisory@tributech.io)
- Tributech Open DataSpace Network - please contact our [Customer Advisory Team](mailto:customer-advisory@tributech.io)

## Install a DataSpace Node

To install a DataSpace Node, you have to meet the infrastructure requirements as mentioned above, and you need to execute the installation script with the matching configuration for the selected ecosystem.

Self-installation is currently not supported, please contact the ecosystem operator or our [Customer Advisory Team](mailto:customer-advisory@tributech.io)
